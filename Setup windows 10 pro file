STEP 1:

First of all we’ll need to extract the content of Windows 10 setup ISO file. You can extract it using 7-Zip. It’ll take some time in extracting the whole ISO file.

STEP 2:

Now open Notepad and copy/paste following piece of code in Notepad:

[EditionID]
Professional
[Channel]
Retail

Create_EI_CFG_File_Windows_10.png

You can also totally skip the [EditionID] part in the “ei.cfg” file so that Windows 10 setup asks you to choose desired edition at the time of clean installation:

[Channel]
Retail

Now save the file with the name “ei.cfg” (use the double-quotes “” while saving the file otherwise Notepad will create a text file with the name ei.cfg.txt).

STEP 3:

Now copy the “ei.cfg” file and paste it into Sources folder of Windows 10 setup folder which you got after extracting ISO file using 7-Zip.

Copy_EI_CFG_File_Windows_10_ISO.png

STEP 4:

Now you can create bootable USB drive or burn the files to a DVD and install Windows 10 Pro edition without any problem.
